# eZ angular - AngularJS frontend for eZ Publish

This project is a Proof.Of.Concept for an Angular Based Application displaying content served by 
eZ Publish (http://share.ez.no) over the REST API (https://confluence.ez.no/display/EZP/eZ+Publish+REST+API)cd ..
.

The goal of this is project is to provide a foundation for lightning fast front-end for eZ Publish.

What needs to be dealt with as for now :
- Url Alias handling : providing eZ routing through angular
- SEO optimization : handling of canonical URL, meta data and "shadow" HTML version of the content
- modularity of views : this code has to be as modular as possible to be re-used in a real project
- Keeping Sexy

This project is originally forked from the angular seed repository (https://github.com/angular/angular-seed)
some cleanup will definitly have to be done in the future.

# How-to

in order to make this work you need to :
- Serve these files using either a web server or the node.js application bundled

- Use a Browser to ... (wait for it) ... Browse to the app folder
